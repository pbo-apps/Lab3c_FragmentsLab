https://www.coursera.org/learn/android-programming/home/welcome

Lab Objectives:
Familiarize yourself with the Fragment class. Create a simple application that uses Fragments to
produce a two-pane or single-pane user interface depending on the current deviceâ€™s screen size.
After completing this Lab you should better understand the Fragment class and its lifecycle, and how
Fragments interact with the Activities that host them.
